				<div class="overlay__section-text">
					<p>
						Queering the Map is a community generated counter-mapping platform for digitally
						archiving LGBTQ2IA+ experience in relation to physical space.
					</p>

					<p>
						The platform provides an interface to collaboratively record the cartography of queer
						life—from park benches to the middle of the ocean—in order to preserve our histories and
						unfolding realities, which continue to be invalidated, contested, and erased. From
						collective action to stories of coming out, encounters with violence to moments of
						rapturous love, Queering the Map functions as a living archive of queer life.
					</p>

					<p>
						Through mapping LGBTQ2IA+ experience in its intersectional permutations, the project
						works to generate affinities across difference and beyond borders — revealing the ways
						in which we are intimately connected.
					</p>

					<h2>Territorial Acknowledgment</h2>
					<div class="overlay__section-text">
						<p>
							Queering the Map was initiated on the unceded traditional lands of the Kanien'kehá:ka
							Nation. The island currently called “Montreal” is known as Tiohtia:ke in the language
							of the Kanien'kehá:ka, and it has historically been a meeting place for other
							Indigenous nations.
						</p>

						<p>
							A queer approach to space points out the limitations of the ways in which the world
							around us is produced and normalized by and for certain bodies and not others. It is
							pertinent that we continuously reflect and act on the ways in which LGBTQIA+ life is
							complicit in ongoing processes of settler-colonialism. How does race, gender,
							sexuality, citizenship, ability, and class affect the ways in which we relate to, move
							through, and create space? As a pin on Queering the Map in Honolulu, Hawaii attests:
							“queer liberation must mean decolonization, and decolonization must mean queer
							liberation.”
						</p>

						<p>
							If you are not currently aware of the rightful keepers of the land on which you are
							located, you can learn more at <a
								href="https://www.native-land.ca/"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener">native-land.ca</a
							>. Beyond simply acknowledging the colonial histories of the land on which you are
							located, we encourage you to take concrete steps towards decolonization by learning
							more about the ways in which you can support Indigenous communities in the fight for
							sovereignty.

				<h2>Moderation Guidelines</h2>
				<div class="overlay__section-text">
					<p>
						Posts to Queering the Map are moderated by a small group of volunteers before they
						appear publicly. This to ensure the following are not added to the platform:
					</p>

					<div class="partial_div-numbered">
						<span>1</span>
						<p>
							Breaches of Anonymity <br />
							We do not approve posts that breach your or anyone else's anonymity. This means posts containing
							last names, phone numbers, email addresses, social media handles, or exact addresses will
							not be approved.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="partial_div-numbered">
						<span>2</span>
						<p>
							Hate Speech <br />
							We do not approve posts that degrade or threaten a group of people based on race, ethnicity,
							citizenship, ability, sexuality, sex, gender, or class.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="partial_div-numbered">
						<span>3</span>
						<p>
							Spam/Advertising <br />
							We do not approve spam posts, or advertisements of any kind.
						</p>
					</div>

					<p style="margin-top: 0px;">
						The moderation process is to ensure the safety of the map, and is not about policing
						expressions or identities.
					</p>
					<p>
						Given the amount of posts that have been made over the past few months, we are at a
						significant moderation backlog, and are doing our best to publish posts as quickly as we
						can. We appreciate your patience.
					</p>

				<h2>Request Removal</h2>

				<h2>Why can’t I see my post on the map?</h2>
				<div class="overlay__section-text">
					<p>
						In 99.9% of cases, it is because it has not been reviewed by our moderation team yet.

					<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						The Queering the Map website, application and other services (the “Queering the Ma
						Services”) are made available to you in accordance with these Terms by Queering the Map
						(“Queering the Map”, “we”, “our”, “us”). These terms and conditions of use, together
						with our Privacy Policy and all supplemental terms (as amended from time to time), other
						documents and policies that are expressly referenced in these terms and conditions (the
						“Terms”), govern your use of the Services.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please read these Terms carefully. These Terms form a legally binding contract between
						you and us. By downloading, accessing or otherwise using any Queering the Map Services
						in any way, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to be bound by
						these Terms you should not access, post User Content on, or otherwise engage with any
						Queering the Map Services.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please keep a copy of these terms for future reference. You should check these terms
						every time you use any Queering the Map Services as we may change these terms at any
						time in accordance with the process set out at Section 2 below.
					</p>

					<h2>2. Changes To These Terms</h2>
					<p>
						We may change these Terms to reflect: (a) changes in applicable laws; (b) regulatory or
						security requirements; (c) relevant guidance or codes of practice; (d) technical
						alterations to Queering the Map Services; (e) improvements for clarity and consistency;
						or (f) any other reason within our sole discretion.
					</p>

					<p>
						Please check the Terms whenever you use any Queering the Map Services. We will treat
						your continued use of the Queering the Map Services as acceptance of any changes made to
						the Terms from the previous version. If you do not agree with the changes you should
						stop using our Services.
					</p>

					<h2>3. Your Right to Post User Content</h2>
					<p>
						Queering The Map (‘the Service’) allows you to post content. You retain any and all of
						your rights to any content you submit, post or display on or through Queering The Map
						and you are responsible for protecting those rights.
					</p>

					<p>
						By posting content through the Service, you grant the Service the unlimited and
						worldwide right and license, without any monetary compensation, to use, modify, publicly
						perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such content on and through the
						Service, and its derivatives in any and all media and format, whether such Service
						and/or derivatives are distributed directly by us or through third parties under license
						by us. You agree that this license includes the right for the Service to make your
						content available to other users of the Service and its derivatives, who may also use,
						share, repost and/or display your content subject to these terms.
					</p>

					<p>
						You represent and warrant that: (i) the content you post is yours (you own it) or you
						have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these terms,
						and (ii) the posting of your content on or through the Service and the exercise by the
						Service or any third-party licensee of any of the rights granted by you under these

						conflict or inconsistency or clarification required with other language versions. The
						headings in these Terms are for ease of reference only and shall be disregarded in

						the force majeure event and for such time after that event ceases as is necessary for us
						to start satisfying our obligations again. For so long as such force majeure event is
						continuing, our corresponding obligations under these Terms shall be suspended to the
						same extent. If such force majeure continues for a continuous period in excess of four
						months, we may terminate access to the Queering the Map Services immediately on service
